# PageView

A container view that manages navigation between related views. 

Pages are navigated directly by the user with a gesture, or programmatically 
through either the selection binding or the environment's navigation action.

## Creating a PageView

There are two ways to initialise a `PageView`. The simplest is with a `ForEach` 
data source:

```swift 
@State private var selection: Int = 1

var body: some View {
    PageView(selection: $selection) {
        ForEach(1...10, id: \.self) { id in
            Text("Page \(value)")
        }
    }
    .pageViewStyle(.scroll)
}
```
        
Alternatively you can you can use the next and previous closure to return a 
value relative to another value: 

```swift 
@State private var selection: Int = 1

var body: some View {
    PageView(selection: $selection) { value in
        value + 1
    } previous: { value in
        value > 1 ? value - 1 : nil
    } content: { value in
        Text("Page \(value)")
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> A page view has no gestures or interactions by default. You must add a style 
before you can interact with it.

## Styles and Transitions

The exact navigation gesture or transition depends on the chosen style. By default
a page view has no transitions or gestures.

Style           | iOS   | macOS
------------    | ----- | ------
`.plain`        | ✅    | ✅
`.scroll`       | ✅    | ✅
`.book`         | ✅    | 
`.historyStack` |       | ✅
`.bookStack`    |       | ✅
`.cardDeck`     | ✅    |

You set a style with the view modifier:

```swift 
PageView(selection: $selection) {
    ...
}
.pageViewStyle(.bookStack)
```

Under the hood some styles such as scroll and history bridge directly to 
`UIPageViewController` and `NSPageController` respectively.
 
## Page Orientation 

Styles that support support vertical and horizontal navigation (`scroll` and `book`)
can be configured with the orientation view modifier: 

```swift 
.pageViewOrientation(.vertical)
```

Controls such as `PageViewNavigationButton` also respond to this modifier adapting 
the chevron direction as appropriate.
 
## Custom Styles

You can create your own completely custom page view transitions and interactions.
To create a custom style declare a type that conforms to the `PageViewStyle` 
protocol and implement the required `makeBody(configuration:)` method. For example, 
here’s how the plain style is implemented:

```swift 
public struct PlainPageViewStyle: PageViewStyle {

   public init() { }

   public func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
       ZStack {
           configuration.content(configuration.selection.wrappedValue)
       }
   }
}
```

You use the `PageViewStyleConfiguration` structure to get access to content,
next, previous and currently selected page.

## Navigation 

In addition to controlling the current page with the selection binding, you can
also use the environment's `PageViewNavigateAction` action to navigate the page 
view backwards and forwards. 

```swift 
@Environment(\.navigatePageView) private var navigate
@Environment(\.canNavigatePageView) private var canNavigate
    
var body: some View {
    Button {
        navigate(.forwards)
    } label: {
        Text("Next")
    }
    .disabled(!canNavigate.contains(.forwards))
}
```

Included is also `PageViewNavigationButton` which provides standardised 
forwards and backwards controls:

```swift 
PageView {
    ...
}
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItem {
        PageViewNavigationButton()
            .pageViewOrientation(.vertical)
    }
}
.pageViewEnvironment()
```

# PageIndicator

A control that displays a horizontal series of dots, each of which corresponds 
to a page.

    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://github.com/notsobigcompany/BigUIPaging/assets/595891/65e144eb-f6ac-4a4d-b447-95d9b1479e6d 3x">
    <img alt="Page indicator" src="https://github.com/notsobigcompany/BigUIPaging/assets/595891/65e144eb-f6ac-4a4d-b447-95d9b1479e6d">
</picture>

You create a page indicator by setting the total number of pages and passing a binding to some selection state:

```swift 
@State private var selection = 1

var body: some View {
    PageIndicator(selection: $selection, total: 5)
}
```

This control bridges directly to `UIPageControl` on iOS. 

## Indicator Appearance 

You can control the indicator's appearance with a number of style modifiers: 

```swift 
/// The tint color to apply to the page indicator.
.pageIndicatorColor(.purple)

/// The tint color to apply to the current page indicator.
.pageIndicatorCurrentColor(.pink)

/// A Boolean value that determines whether the page control allows continuous interaction.
.allowsContinuousInteraction(true)

/// The preferred background style.
.pageIndicatorBackgroundStyle(.prominent)

/// Controls whether the page indicator is hidden when there is only one page.
.singlePageVisibility(.hidden)
```

## Page Progress

A page indicator can automatically advance to the next page after a set duration.

```swift
PageIndicator...
    .pageIndicatorDuration(3.0)
```

This can also be used to drive a `PageView` if the selection binding is shared
between the two views.

## Indicator Icons 

You can customise an indicator's icon to denote special pages, such as how the 
Weather app uses the first page to represent the user's current location:

<picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://github.com/notsobigcompany/BigUIPaging/assets/595891/4ebfb426-0f79-4f8d-bc54-684f98c61f14 3x">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://github.com/notsobigcompany/BigUIPaging/assets/595891/d8d2b646-bfe1-4acb-93ce-206d4bebb5df 3x">
    <img alt="Page indicator" src="https://github.com/notsobigcompany/BigUIPaging/assets/595891/d8d2b646-bfe1-4acb-93ce-206d4bebb5df">
</picture>

Icon customisations are provided in the form of a view builder. The first parameter represents 
the page index and the second the selected state.

```swift 
// Vary icons depending on page
PageIndicator(selection: $selection, total: total) { (page, selected) in
    if page == 0 {
        Image(systemName: "location.fill")
    }
}

// Vary icons depending on selection state
PageIndicator(selection: $selection, total: total) { (page, selected) in
    if selected {
        Image(systemName: "folder.fill")
    } else {
        Image(systemName: "folder")
    }
}
```   

> [!NOTE]  
> Only the systemName initialiser is currently supported.

# Installation 

BigUIPaging is available as a Swift Package. Just add this repository to your
 `Package.swift` file:

```swift 
.package(url: "https://github.com/notsobigcompany/BigUIPaging.git", from: "0.0.1")
```

If you’re adding to an Xcode project go to File -> Add Packages, then link
the package to your required target.

# Sample Code

Take a look at the `Examples` folder inside the package and open the Xcode Preview Canvas.

You can also find sample code in the [documentation](https://opensource.notsobig.company/documentation/bigswiftui/paging). 

# Why use PageView over TabView?

PageView is intended for navigating a large number of views where all the
pages may not be known on initial load. The next and previous closures allow
for pages to be decided 'in flight'.

PageView also handles more complex layouts correctly, such as if your app makes 
use of a `NavigationStack` or `NavigationSplitView`. Scroll events are correctly 
forwarded to the view hierarchy and toolbar items aren't interfered with.

And by adopting `PageViewStyle` there are infinite transition and interaction 
possibilities.

Finally PageView has consistent behaviour across all platforms whereas TabView
only supports paging on iOS.
